\section{Goal of this Lab Work Session}

The goal of this lab work session is to write a simulator of the famous Pacman game.

You shall learn: 
\begin{itemize}
\item How to write the agent perception computation.
\item How to write the Ghost behavior.
\end{itemize}

\input{../common/install}

\section{Brief Description of the Code Skeleton}

The skeleton contains an implementation of the environment model (a maze) \texttt{fr.utbm.info.ia54.environment}, and the agent that is managing the environment.
The subpackages are or will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{fr.utbm.info.ia54.environment.maze} is the package that contains the definition of the maze, and the objects inside.
\item \texttt{fr.utbm.info.ia54.environment.agent} is the package in which you could find the definition of the agent and the interaction space that are needed for supported the maze environment in the simulation.
\end{itemize}

\emph{It is recommended to read this code and the associated Javadoc.}

The package \texttt{fr.utbm.info.ia54.players} contains the playing agents, i.e. the ghosts.

The packages \texttt{fr.utbm.info.ia54.math} and \texttt{fr.utbm.info.ia54.ui} contain mathematical tools and the graphical user interface.
The file \texttt{fr/utbm/info/ia54/PacManSimulator.java} contains the main program.

\section{Work to be Done during the Lab Work Session}

The following sections describe the work to be done during this lab work session.

\subsection{Capacity to Manage a Maze}

The agent \texttt{Environment} is in charge of managing the maze and the interactions with the playing agents (the ghosts), and the pacman.
The agent \texttt{Environment} has the knowledge of the maze. 
It means that this agent has the capacity to manage the maze.
This capacity is \texttt{MazeManager}, defined in the file \texttt{fr/utbm/info/ia54/environment/agent/Capacities.sarl}.


You must create a skill, i.e. an implementation of a capacity, for the capacity \texttt{MazeManager}.
In the code skeleton, this skill is named \texttt{DefaultMazeManagerSkill}, and all the functions marked with \code {TODO} must be coded.
The skill contains a reference to the maze.

You should:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item implement the functions in \texttt{DefaultMazeManagerSkill} that implements the functions defined in \texttt{MazeManager}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ghost Behavior}

The agent \texttt{Ghost} must be defined in the file \texttt{fr/utbm/info/ia54/players/Players.sarl}

This agent should:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pursue the pacman if it is in the field-of-view of the ghost, and the pacman has no super power.
\item Evade the pacman if it is in the field-of-view of the ghost, and the pacman has the super power.
\item Move randomly, but avoiding to turn back in the middle of a corridor.
\end{itemize}
